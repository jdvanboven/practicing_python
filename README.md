As python practice, I am coding a game of Connect Four that can be played in the terminal.
You can start the game with the following command:

python -i connect-four-game.py

The game will ask you for a column number. To make a move, type the number of the column you want to play your piece in and press enter. Take turns with the other player (or yourself :) ) and enjoy the game!
